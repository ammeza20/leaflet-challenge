Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

Project Overview

This project utilizes the Leaflet.js library to visualize real-time earthquake data on an interactive map. The data is sourced from the USGS GeoJSON feed, and various features such as popups, color-coded markers, and legends have been implemented to enhance the user experience.

Technologies Used

Leaflet.js: Interactive mapping library

D3.js: Data-driven visualization

HTML5 & CSS3: Structure and styling

JavaScript (ES6): Fetching and processing earthquake data

Features

Interactive Map: Displays earthquake locations using Leaflet.js

Real-time Data: Retrieves earthquake data from USGS GeoJSON feed

Color-Coded Markers: Represent earthquake magnitude and depth

Popups: Provide details on each earthquake

Legend: Helps users interpret the color-coded depth markers

Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/leaflet-earthquake.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd leaflet-earthquake

Open index.html in a browser to view the interactive map.

Data Source

The earthquake data is retrieved from the USGS GeoJSON Feed:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

Future Enhancements

Implement tectonic plate overlay for better geological context

Add timeline filtering to visualize earthquakes over time

Improve UI with additional styling and animations
